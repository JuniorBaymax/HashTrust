To strengthen your thought process around React, let’s write some reactjs programs.
Write a program that displays “Hello World!”.
Create a “Text” Component which accepts a message(string) as props, and display it.
Create a “Button” Component that accepts, labels (string) and onClick(function) as props. onClick function to be called when you click on the button.
Create an “InputText” component. This component will take Placeholder, value and handleChange as props. The placeholder will be shown when there is no value. Value Props is the value that needs to be displayed in the input component. handleChange will call the function whenever the value of the input field is changed.
Let’s create a page using the above component. Take input from the user in the “Input” component. When the user clicks on the Button component, then show the input text in the “Text” component and empty the Input component.
